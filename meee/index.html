     <h2>QUINN FIELD</h2>
     <p>I have many goals I would like to accomplish this semester. The first goal is to become comfortable using html and css so that I can have confidence in crafting a diverse range of web projects. I want to be able to speak the language of html and css with confidence. The goal is to eventually be able to build sites for clients, as a number of people have asked me and I havent had the complete knowledge yet. The last goal I have this semester is learning how to design webpages for a variety of screens, such as iPhones! </p>
     <p>Two of my very favorite websites are Instagram and YouTube. I enjoy showcasing my art and videos on Instgram since its such a large community of people from all over the world. The pictures and videos people share all live in a giant server somewhere in the world, accessed from the air. I also like youtube in being able to watch vlogs of people half way around the world right at my finger tips!</p>
     <p> I have several ideas of a final project. One of the ideas I have is to create a personal portfolio site showing the work I have done. Another idea would be to create a store for selling my art work or making one for my family in the things they want to create.</p>
